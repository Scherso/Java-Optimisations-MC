# Java-Optimisations-MC
This repository serves to provide effective ways of improving performance in minecraft, with a focus on lunar client using different Java distributions and options.
It is the goal of this repository to have discourse over different java configurations and the effects they have, and provide simple access to different configurations.
Please open an issue if you have a possible configuration with improved performance, with benchmarks to support them.

## Java Distribution
The GraalVM distribution of Java, is made by Oracle, and is equipped with an [advanced](https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/) Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that possibly has [the best performance](https://renaissance.dev/) for long-during intensive tasks. The newest version of the [the community version](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/tag/vm-22.0.0.2) is open-source. The [enterprise edition](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/graalvm-downloads.html#license-lightbox) is closed-source but may have slight improvements over the community edition, but requires registration at Oracle's website. Lunar Client requires a Java version of 16 or above. GraalVM provides Java 17, which is recommended.

## Java Options
For the Enterprise Edition:
```yml
-Xverify:none -Xss2M -Xmn1G -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=2M -XX:GCTimeLimit=50 -server -XX:-UsePerfData -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -XX:+UseLargePages -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:JVMCIThreads=2 -XX:+EliminateLocks -XX:+AggressiveHeap -Dgraal.TuneInlinerExploration=1 -XX:+EagerJVMCI

```
For the Community Edition:
```yml
-Xverify:none -Xss2M -Xmn1G -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=2M -XX:GCTimeLimit=50 -server -XX:-UsePerfData -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -XX:+UseLargePages -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:JVMCIThreads=2 -XX:+EliminateLocks -XX:+AggressiveHeap -XX:+EagerJVMCI

```
* Xverify:none causes bytecode not to be checked during runtime. This option is safe to disable on trusted code and speeds up load times.
* Xss2M sets the stacks size from the default 1M on 64-bit Java, to 2M. I have noticed a slight increase in performance with this option.
* Xmn1G sets the size of the heap for young generation objects i.e. those with short life-span to 1 gigabyte. This option's effects have been [documented](https://hypixel.net/threads/getting-better-fps-stablity-by-using-another-jre-with-lunar-client.4518890/).
* XX:G1HeapRegionSize=2M sets the G1 garbage collectors heap region size to 2M, this option needs to be tested more thoroughly with different values.
* XX:GCTimeLimit=50 sets the desired ime for garbage collection to take. An amount that is too short may have unwanted consequences. 50 is by many seen as optimal for Minecraft.
* server enables experimental options in the JVM, among with using the optimal garbage collector.
* XX:-UsePerfData disables data collection and writing of information about performance into files, which may slightly increase performance.
* XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem disables some data collection and features of the JVM, but they are not needed in normal usage of Minecraft.
* XX:+UseLargePages enables usage of large pages which may improve performance. You **must give the user access to this right which is not given by default**. To use this feature refer to [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/largememory-pages.html).
* XX:+AlwaysPreTouch results in performance improvements, with the reason described [here](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2685771).
* XX:JVMCIThreads=2 sets two threads to the JVM Compiler. The effects of this are not well documented.
* XX:+EliminateLocks enhances performance when multiple threads.
* XX:+AggressiveHeap may enhance performance by more aggressively storing things in memory. It does result in more memory usage.
* Dgraal.TuneInlinerExploration=1 is an option that in my testing has improved performance on 1. Information is about it is [here](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/java/options/). It only takes effect on the enterprise edition of GraalVM.
* XX:+EagerJVMCI enables the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler in GraalVM.

## Discourse resulting in improvement
Different java configurations work differently on different systems, but a 64-bit configuration with about 2-4 GB of RAM available to be allocated to minecraft and at least 4 cores is targeted. If you have suggestions for improvements, please explain why your change would improve performance, and it is best if you provide a simple benchmark, using for example [CapFrameX](https://github.com/CXWorld/CapFrameX).
